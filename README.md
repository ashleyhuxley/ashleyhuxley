### About Me

I'm a **Senior Software Developer** with 20+ years of professional experience solving interesting, tricky problems across desktop, mobile, cloud, and embedded systems. My main focus and area of expertise is on back end development.

I love **interesting and unusual software challenges** - the kind where you're building something that requires thought, planning and the right set of skills to solve problems that may be entirely new. Right now, that means writing a custom **high-performance MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)** from the ground up, but over my career itâ€™s ranged from **full featured internal business systems for both small and large enterprises** to **multiplayer hardware games on the flipper zero**.
